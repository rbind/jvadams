I happened across this tweet today,

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< tweet 703975756146352128 >}}")`

and (offensive language aside) it had the intended effect. I've decided to give blogging about code a try. I particularly appreciated the advice offered by [Garann Means](http://garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/), to keep it low key: 

* no quality control
* assume no one will ever see it
* write like yourself
* drink
* actually write about code
* moderate comments
* don't hit post immediately
* promote it. or don't.
* just please please please do it
