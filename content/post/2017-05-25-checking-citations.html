<p>If you conduct peer reviews of manuscripts for publication, you will do the author(s) a great favor by double checking their citations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is every work cited in the body of their text listed in the references section?</li>
<li>Is every work listed in the references section cited in the body of the text?</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking for one-to-one correspondence manually is time consuming. That’s why it’s so common to find mismatches.</p>
<p>You can make the job a bit easier using the <code>xCitations()</code> function of the <a href="https://github.com/JVAdams/jvamisc"><strong>jvamisc</strong></a> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(jvamisc)
xCitations</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function (file = NULL, txt = NULL) 
## {
##     if (is.null(txt)) 
##         txt &lt;- readLines(file)
##     x1 &lt;- unlist(str_extract_all(txt, pattern = &quot;\\(.*?\\)&quot;))
##     x &lt;- unlist(str_extract_all(x1, &quot;[A-Z].*?[0-9]{4}&quot;))
##     return(sort(unique(x)))
## }
## &lt;environment: namespace:jvamisc&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I based the function on code posted by Kay Cichini on 26 Mar 2012 on <a href="http://thebiobucket.blogspot.com/2012/03/how-to-extract-citation-from-body-of.html">theBioBucket</a>. I wanted something simple to serve my purposes, so I built the function to take either a text file path or object as input, and the function returns a sorted vector of the unique citations. This makes it easy for me to (yes, this part is still manual) compare them to the works listed in the references.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x &lt;- paste(&quot;Yarmouth (1977) said something.&quot;,
 &quot;Evidence of x (Barber and Jones 1991),&quot;,
 &quot;y (House et al. 1982),&quot;,
 &quot;and z (Smith 1990; Folger and Penn 2000).&quot;)
xCitations(txt=x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Barber and Jones 1991&quot; &quot;Folger and Penn 2000&quot;  &quot;House et al. 1982&quot;    
## [4] &quot;Smith 1990&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that this function does <strong>not</strong> capture citations in which the author is mentioned directly in the text and only the year is in parentheses, <em>Yarmouth (1977)</em> in the example.</p>

<h2>Room for improvement:</h2>
<ul>
<li>My current approach is to copy and paste the contents of a manuscript (a Word document) into a text file (removing all images), then using <code>xCitations()</code> on the text file.
<ul>
<li>This works well for a Word document, but being able to read <strong>the Word file directly</strong> would be an improvement.</li>
<li>This does not work as well for manuscripts in PDF files, because citations that are wrapped across multiple lines would be missed. Being able to <strong>read the PDF file directly</strong> would be an improvement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My current approach is to manually compare the returned vector of citations with the list of references in the manuscript.
<ul>
<li>Fully <strong>automating this process</strong> would be an improvement.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
