<p>I wanted to create an animated GIF using images I found on the internet, the reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States from 2001 to 2014. The images are located on the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html">CDC website for Lyme disease</a>, named <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/images/maps/map5.jpg">map5</a> through <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/images/maps/map18.jpg">map18</a>.</p>
<p>My original intention was to explore the capabilities of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to do this. However, the solutions I found seemed to rely on another software package, <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, which I didn’t want to install. So, I punted on using R.</p>
<p>Next I tried GIMP (which I already had installed), but I didn’t quickly find a way to open/import several images from URLs as layers. So, I punted on using GIMP as well.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to try <a href="https://giphy.com/">GIPHY</a>. GIPHY had an option to create a slideshow where I could pretty quickly (but still, one at a time) copy and paste each of the image URLs to create an animated GIF. I copied each of the images once, except for the last year (2014), which I copied a few times, so that when the GIF goes through its continuous loop, it pauses for the last year of mapped data.</p>
<p>I’m pleased with the results, but not with the process. I was looking for a solution with code, and came up short.</p>

<p>I shared the GIF on Twitter …</p>
