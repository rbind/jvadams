I started a blog in early 2016, focused on [R](https://www.r-project.org/) coding.  I was full of enthusiasm, but quickly grew frustrated with trying to post my code and output on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user).  Predictably, my posts began to fizzle out.

Then I learned about [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/)'s R package [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) which makes creating blog posts directly from R markdown files a breeze.

So, I am up and running again.  And it works great!
