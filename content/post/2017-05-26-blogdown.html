<p>I started a blog in early 2016, focused on <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> coding. I was full of enthusiasm, but quickly grew frustrated with trying to post my code and output on <a href="https://www.blogger.com/about/?r=1-null_user">Blogger</a>. Predictably, my posts began to fizzle out.</p>
<p>Then I learned about <a href="https://yihui.name/en/">Yihui Xie</a>â€™s R package <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> which makes creating blog posts directly from R markdown files a breeze.</p>
<p>So, I am up and running again. And it works great!</p>
