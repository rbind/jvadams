<p>Area plots are used to show changing contributions to a total over time. The time series for each contribution is stacked on top of one another using different colors, as in this example,</p>
{{< tweet 992463367385370624 >}}
<p>But it can be hard to pick up on patterns in the data from an area plot. The patterns in the category placed at the bottom of the stack ripple up through the other layers. What if the order of the categories were reversed?</p>
<p>I downloaded the source data for the plot above (catch in millions of metric tonnes) and gave it a try.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># annual sum of catch in millions of metric tonnes
df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;http://data.imas.utas.edu.au/attachments/ff1274e1-c0ab-411b-a8a2-5a12eb27f2c0/Index.csv&quot;, 
  col_types=cols()) %&gt;%
  select(Year, IndReported, IndIUU, IndDiscards, 
    NIndReported, NIndIUU, NIndDiscards) %&gt;%
  group_by(Year) %&gt;%
  summarise_all(function(x) sum(x/1000000)) %&gt;%
  gather(Category, Catch, -Year) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    Category = factor(Category, levels=c(&quot;IndReported&quot;, &quot;IndIUU&quot;,
      &quot;IndDiscards&quot;, &quot;NIndReported&quot;, &quot;NIndIUU&quot;, &quot;NIndDiscards&quot;))
  )

<p>Moving the Industrial Reported catch from the bottom of the stack to the top definitely helps, but itâ€™s not a perfect solution. For example, the bump in the yellow Non-Industrial IUU (illegal, unreported, and unregulated) in the late 1980s ripples up through the categories above it.</p>
<p>Do the categories really need to be stacked? A line plot will not suffer from this ripple effect.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df2 &lt;- df %&gt;%
  separate(Category, c(&quot;Source&quot;, &quot;Type&quot;), &quot;Ind&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(
    Source = factor(Source, levels=c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), labels=c(&quot;Industrial&quot;, &quot;Non-Industrial&quot;)),
    Type = factor(Type, levels=c(&quot;Reported&quot;, &quot;IUU&quot;, &quot;Discards&quot;), 
      labels=c(&quot;Reported&quot;, &quot;Illegal, Unrept., Unreg.&quot;, 
        &quot;Discards&quot;))
  )

ggplot(df2, aes(Year, Catch, color=Type, linetype=Source)) +
  geom_line(size=1) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values=c(&quot;#000000&quot;, &quot;#56B4E9&quot;, &quot;#E69F00&quot;)) +
  labs(y=&quot;Catch  (Mt)&quot;, 
    subtitle=&quot;Estimated global marine fishing catch&quot;) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-05-06-area-chart-alternatives_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now there is no ripple effect, but the difference in scale makes it hard to discern patterns in all but the Industrial Reported catch. This could be avoided by plotting each line on its own scale.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(df2, aes(Year, Catch)) +
  geom_line(size=1) + 
  facet_wrap(Source ~ Type, scales=&quot;free&quot;) +
  labs(y=&quot;Catch  (Mt)&quot;, 
    subtitle=&quot;Estimated global marine fishing catch&quot;) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)</code></pre>

<p>This last view shows patterns in the time series that were not necessarily evident in the previous plots. Industrial catch seems to have leveled off since the 1990s, whereas Non-Industrial catch continues to increase. Non-Industrial Reported and IUU catches both have a 5-year cycle of peaks and valleys. And look at that spike in Industrial IUU in 1989.</p>
<p>Bottom line? There is no silver bullet, no one chart that does it all.</p>
