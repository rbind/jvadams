<p>I recently received an e-mail from the American Statistical Association (<a href="https://www.amstat.org">ASA</a>) about the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/giving/helenwalkersociety.cfm">Helen Walker Society</a>. The e-mail listed the 14 <em>“distinguished women leaders who have held the office of ASA president”</em> going back to Helen Walker in 1944.</p>
<p>Really? Fourteen? All the way back to 1944? Wow.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to visualize the percentage of female ASA presidents over time. I found a listing of ASA presidents on <a href="%22https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_American_Statistical_Association%22">Wikipedia</a> and used the data to create a timeline.</p>

<p>I then calculated the rolling 10-year percentage of ASA presidents that were female and plotted the results.</p>

  mutate(
    mean10 = 100*rollmean(Sex==&quot;Female&quot;, 10, align=&quot;right&quot;, fill=NA)

<p><img src="/post/2016-04-22-female-asa-presidents_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>There were three female ASA presidents between 1944 and 1956, followed by a 23-year period during which all the ASA presidents were male (1957-1979). Since then, the percentage of female ASA presidents has risen, reaching 50% for the first time during the 10-year period from 2004 to 2013. Excellent.</p>
