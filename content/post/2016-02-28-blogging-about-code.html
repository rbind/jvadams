<p>I happened across this tweet today,</p>
{{< tweet 703975756146352128 >}}
<p>and (offensive language aside) it had the intended effect. I’ve decided to give blogging about code a try. I particularly appreciated the advice offered by <a href="http://garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/">Garann Means</a>, to keep it low key:</p>
<ul>
<li>no quality control</li>
<li>assume no one will ever see it</li>
<li>write like yourself</li>
<li>drink</li>
<li>actually write about code</li>
<li>moderate comments</li>
<li>don’t hit post immediately</li>
<li>promote it. or don’t.</li>
<li>just please please please do it</li>
</ul>
