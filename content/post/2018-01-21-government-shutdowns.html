<p>Facing another U.S. government shutdown, I came across an article on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/19/16905584/government-shutdown-history-clinton-obama-explained">Vox.com</a> describing the 18 previous shutdowns. The article stated that <em>“… they’re a relatively recent development … the result of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.”</em></p>
<p>I was curious to visualize the timing and the duration of the shutdowns. Happily, the beginning and ending dates were reported in the article. I hand entered the data (it seemed faster than scraping). In terms of writing an <strong>R</strong> script, the only trick was creating date variables (<code>plot.From</code> and <code>plot.To</code>) for plotting that used a single fiscal year (FY2001).</p>

<p>There have been 18 shutdowns so far (not including this latest one), but sometimes there was more than one shutdown in a year. There have been shutdowns in 13 fiscal years since 1974; that’s an average of 1 shutdown every 3.4 years. The average total duration of the shutdowns in a given fiscal year was 8.4 days.</p>
