<p>Do you deer hunt in Wisconsin? Have you had your deer tested for chronic wasting disease? I recently learned the results of the test on my deer and was curious about the results statewide.</p>
<div id="bringing-in-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Bringing in the data</h1>
<p>The county data are available online at <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/wmcwd/Summary/County">dnr.wi.gov</a>. I used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html">SelectorGadget</a> to identify the columns of data I wanted from each page and the <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/">rvest</a> package of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to do the extraction, looping through the pages with different years of data. You can see the code that I used <a href="https://github.com/rbind/jvadams/blob/master/content/post/2019-12-24-chronic-wasting-disease-in-wisconsin-deer.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
<p>In preparation for mapping the results, I also downloaded state and county mapping data for Wisconsin from the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="summarizing-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Summarizing the data</h1>
<p>Then I summarized the test data, determining the first year that CWD was detected in each county and the percentage of positive results over all tests during 1999-2019 and just during 2019.</p>
<p>Since 1999, <strong>28</strong> of 72 Wisconsin counties have tested positive for CWD, including <strong>2</strong> counties that tested positive for the first time in 2019: <strong>Sheboygan, Dunn</strong>.</p>

<h1>Mapping the data</h1>
<p>I used the data to create a county map showing the percentage of positive results in 2019, the counties that have never tested positive for CWD, and the first year of detection.</p>
<p>Then I created a whole series of maps, one for each year of testing, to see how the counties with positive detections have expanded over time.</p>

<div id="plotting-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Plotting the data</h1>
<p>Finally, to see the progression of the infection in the deer population over time, I plotted the percentage of positive results for every county that ever had a positive test. I only show percentages for years with at least 8 deer tested in each county. (<em>The combined data from 1999-2001 is plotted at 2000.</em>)</p>
