<p>Twitter is one way that I keep up to date on Great Lakes news. Might I be missing out on some good Great Lakes tweeters? I used the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a> package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=rtweet">rtweet</a> to investigate (see this <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/intro.html">vignette</a>).</p>

<p>First, I looked at the last 18,000 tweets that mentioned the Great Lakes. These tweets go back 8.1 days.</p>
<p>Then I counted up the number of Great Lakes tweets for each tweeter.</p>
